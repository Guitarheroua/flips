# [FLIP 229] Access Streaming API Expansion

## Objective

This FLIP document aims to logically extend the functionality proposed in [FLIP73](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/main/protocol/20230309-accessnode-event-streaming-api.md).

## Motivation and User Benefit

The newly implemented Access Streaming API offers limited functionality, featuring a single gRPC subscription, `SubscribeExecutionData`, and one gRPC/REST subscription, `SubscribeEvents` (see [onflow/flow-go#3723](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/3723) for implementation detail). On the other hand, the regular polling Access API version has a variety of endpoints for use. This FLIP identifies essential subscriptions within the current Access Subscription API, crucially based on user proposals, aiming to expand its functionality. Furthermore, it addresses recommended improvements to existing REST WebSocket connections, as suggested by the community, aimed at resolving issues arising from a large number of connections while maintaining granularity within the subscription API.

The enhanced version seeks to provide a simpler and more efficient REST WebSocket connection, offering a broader range of useful subscription endpoints for obtaining blockchain updates.

## Design Proposal

The Access Node Subscription API would introduce the following new streaming endpoints:

- SubscribeBlocks
- SubscribeBlockHeaders
- SubscribeBlocksLightweight
- SendAndSubscribeTransactionStatuses
- SubscribeAccountStatuses

Additionally, it proposes an improved version of the REST WebSocket Subscription with a single connection.

### WebSocket Subscriptions with a Single Connection

In the current version of REST subscription, [a new WebSocket connection is created](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/9577079fd24aad4c1fc1fc8710ef2686ead85ca4/engine/access/rest/routes/websocket_handler.go#L288) for each subscription request. However, with the potential growth in the number of endpoints available for subscription, this behavior becomes undesirable due to several reasons:

- It results in a system for connection handling on the client side that is difficult to maintain.
- It causes unnecessary network load, impacting the overall performance of the application.
- Eventually, it will hit the connection limit, posing constraints.
- It complicates future expansion efforts.

To address this, an improvement in WebSocket behavior is proposed by implementing a single connection for each subscription. This improvement is commonly referred to as the "WebSocket Components Subscription Pattern", and an example of its React implementation can be found [here](https://blog.stackademic.com/websockets-and-react-wscontext-and-components-subscription-pattern-4e580fc67bb5).

The proposed enhancement involves the following aspects:

- The `WSHandler` will initiate a connection only for the initial subscription and retain it for subsequent subscriptions.
- An unsubscribe mechanism will be introduced. With multiple subscriptions on a single connection, simply closing this connection to halt updates becomes insufficient. Therefore, a dedicated endpoint for unsubscribing from undesired updates is necessary.
- Each subscription response will now include a message type. For instance, the `SubscribeEvents` endpoint will result in a message with `type: "Events"`, while `SubscribeBlockHeaders` will yield `type: "BlockHeader"` in messages, and so forth. This is essential to distinguish between various subscription results that will be delivered through a single connection.

### SubscribeBlocks

This endpoint enables users to subscribe to the streaming of blocks, commencing from a provided block ID or height. Additionally, users are required to specify the desired status of the streamed blocks to receive. Each block's response should include the `Block` containing `Header` and `Payload`.

- **BlockHeight** (Block height of the streamed block)
- **BlockId** (Block ID of the streamed block)
- **BlockStatus** (`BlockStatusSealed` or `BlockStatusFinalized`)

Usage example:

```go
req := &access.SubscribeBlocksRequest{
    // If no start block height or ID is provided, the latest block is used
    StartBlockHeight: 1234,
    // or StartBlockID: startBlockID[:],
    BlockStatus: BlockStatus.BlockStatusFinalized, // Use BlockStatusSealed to receive only finalized or only sealed blocks
}

stream, err := client.SubscribeBlocks(ctx, req)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("error subscribing to blocks: %v", err)
}

for {
    resp, err := stream.Recv()
    if err == io.EOF {
        break
    }

    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("error receiving block: %v", err)
    }

    block := resp.GetBlock()

    log.Printf("received block with ID: %x, Height: %d, and Payload Hash: %x",
        block.ID(),
        block.Header.Height,
        block.Payload.Hash(),
    )
}
```

### SubscribeBlockHeaders

This endpoint enables users to subscribe to the streaming of block headers, commencing from a provided block ID or height. Additionally, users are required to specify the desired status of the streamed blocks to receive. The response for each block header should include the block's `Header`. This is a lighter version of `SubscribeBlocks` as it does not include the heavier `Payload` field.

- **BlockHeight** (Block height of the streamed block)
- **BlockId** (Block ID of the streamed block)
- **BlockStatus** (`BlockStatusSealed` or `BlockStatusFinalized`)

Usage example:

```go
req := &access.SubscribeBlocksRequest{
    // If no start block height or Id is provided, the latest block is used
    StartBlockHeight: 1234,
    // or StartBlockId: startBlockID[:],
    BlockStatus: BlockStatus.BlockStatusFinalized // Use BlockStatusSealed to receive only finalized or only sealed blocks headers
}

stream, err := client.SubscribeBlockHeaders(ctx, req)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("error subscribing to blocks headers: %v", err)

}

for {
	resp, err := stream.Recv()
	if err == io.EOF {
		break
	}

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error receiving block header: %v", err)
	}

    blockHeader := resp.GetBlockHeader()

	log.Printf("received block header with ID: %x, Height: %d and Payload Hash: %x",
		blockHeader.ID(),
		blockHeader.Height,
        blockHeader.PayloadHash,
	)
}
```

### SubscribeBlocksLightweight

This endpoint enables users to subscribe to the streaming of lightweight block information, commencing from a provided block ID or height. Additionally, users are required to specify the desired status of the streamed blocks to receive. The response for each block should include only the block's `ID`, `Height` and `Timestamp`. This is the lightest version among all block subscriptions.

- **BlockHeight** (Block height of the streamed block)
- **BlockId** (Block ID of the streamed block)
- **BlockStatus** (`BlockStatusSealed` or `BlockStatusFinalized`)

Usage example:

```go
req := &access.SubscribeBlocksLightweightRequest{
    // If no start block height or Id is provided, the latest block is used
    StartBlockHeight: 1234,
    // or StartBlockId: startBlockID[:],
    BlockStatus: BlockStatus.BlockStatusFinalized // Returns only finalized blocks. Use BlockStatusSealed to receive only sealed blocks
}

stream, err := client.SubscribeBlocksLightweight(ctx, req)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("error subscribing to lightweight blocks : %v", err)

}

for {
	resp, err := stream.Recv()
	if err == io.EOF {
		break
	}

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error receiving block lightweight: %v", err)
	}

	log.Printf("received lightweight block with ID: %x, Height: %d, parent block ID: %x and Timestamp: %s",
		resp.GetBlockId(),
		resp.GetBlockHeight(),
        resp.GetParentBlockId(),
        resp.GetBlockTimestamp().String(),
	)
}
```

### SendAndSubscribeTransactionStatuses

This endpoint enables users to send a transaction and immediately subscribe to its status changes. The status is streamed back until the block containing the transaction becomes sealed. Each response for the transaction status should include the `ID`, `Status` and `Error` fields.

- **TransactionMsg** (transaction submitted to stream status)

Usage example:

```go
txMsg, err := transactionToMessage(tx)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("error converting transaction to message: %v", err)
}

req := &access.SendTransactionRequest{
    Transaction: txMsg,
}

stream, err := client.SendAndSubscribeTransactionStatuses(ctx, req)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("error subscribing to transaction statuses: %v", err)
}

for {
    resp, err := stream.Recv()
    if err == io.EOF {
        break
    }

    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("error receiving transaction status: %v", err)
    }

    txResult := resp.GetTransactionResult()

    log.Printf("received transaction status with tx ID: %x, status: %s, and error: %v",
        resp.GetTransactionID(),
        txResult.Status.String(),
        txResult.Error,
    )
}
```

### SubscribeAccountStatuses

This endpoint enables users to subscribe to the streaming of account status changes. Each response for the account status should include the `Address` and the `Status` fields ([built-in account event types](https://developers.flow.com/build/basics/events#core-events)). In the future, this endpoint could potentially incorporate additional fields to provide supplementary data essential for tracking alongside the status.

- **Address** (address of the account to stream status changes)
- **Filter** (array of statuses matching the clientâ€™s filter. Any statuses that match at least one of the conditions are returned.)

Usage example:

```go
req := &executiondata.SubscribeAccountStatusesRequest{
    Address: "123456789abcdef0",
    Filter: []string{
        "flow.AccountContractUpdated",
    }
}

stream, err := client.SubscribeAccountStatuses(ctx, req)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("error subscribing to account statuses: %v", err)
}

for {
    resp, err := stream.Recv()
    if err == io.EOF {
        break
    }

    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("error receiving account status: %v", err)
    }

    log.Printf("received account status with address: %s and status: %s",
        resp.Address.String(),
        resp.Status.String(),
    )
}

```

### Future Subscriptions

The `SubscribeResourcesMovement` would enable users to subscribe to the streaming of account resource movement, while `SubscribeResourcesChanges` would allow users to subscribe to the streaming of account resource changes. As these functionalities necessitate additional research and discussions, they will be described and developed in the future.

### Performance Implications

The addition of more subscription endpoints aims to provide users with an efficient means to retrieve promptly available blockchain data, potentially shifting the focus away from polling toward subscription-based access. This transition should decrease unnecessary polling requests for commonly sought-after data, thereby reducing the overall system load. Consequently, users will effortlessly obtain commonly used data without additional complexity on the client side.

Regarding the REST aspect, it's crucial to emphasize the importance of evaluating the efficiency gained by transitioning websocket subscriptions from multiple connections to a single connection. This evaluation should encompass testing for potential limitations, edge cases, and overall performance metrics under normal and critical load conditions.

### Nodes and Clients

The anticipated performance gains and drawbacks should correspond to those outlined in [FLIP73 -> Nodes](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/main/protocol/20230309-accessnode-event-streaming-api.md#nodes) and [FLIP73 -> Clients](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/main/protocol/20230309-accessnode-event-streaming-api.md#clients). However, these outcomes will correlate with a broader range of available endpoints and their respective usage.

### Dependencies

This FLIP should not necessitate any new dependencies. Its foundation will primarily rely on the existing functionality of the Access Streaming API and involve modifications and enhancements to the current codebase.
